âœ… Correct meanings (from C++ STL):
ðŸ”¹ std::lower_bound(begin, end, x)
Finds the first element â‰¥ x

That means it gives the smallest index where value is not less than x

ðŸ”¹ std::upper_bound(begin, end, x)
Finds the first element > x

That means it gives the smallest index where value is strictly greater than x

ðŸ’¡ So in simple terms:

Function	What it returns
lower_bound(x)	First element that is â‰¥ x
upper_bound(x)	First element that is > x
